key notes:

1. Divided the app to two main components, userCard, userList
2. Separated context and api to different files, for more readability and performance.
3. While loading the app userList create api call to get users.
4. Added to userList loading, error and no users found options to show.
5. using useMemo on the api calls so if no changes happen it wont rerender
6. Added to userCard a toast to show if the user is in the failed list.
8. favoritesUsers is an object, which make it better to handle the favorites, also in performance.
9. user getAllSettled to get all the users and handle the errors, to run all requests in parallel.
10. save isFavorite locally to make optimistic ui and update it after the api call.


running the app:
1. npm install
2. npm  run start
